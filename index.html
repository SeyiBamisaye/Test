			<p>I don't know if you have heard of the concerns raised by the former president of the<br> Federal Republic of Nigeria, in about 3 decades we have addded about 80 million to our population<br> which is about the population of France as a whole</p>
	</div>
			<h3><p><strong><i>The main concerns for me are listed below;</i></strong></p></h3>
	<div>
<ol>

<li>Our people from the core northern part of the country</li>
<li>Some people's believe that population is key to holding unto power</li>
<li>The solution is for the country to divide, the northerns can face their problems alone</li>
</ol>

<h3>States with the most population </h3>
		<table >
			<tr>
				<th>SN</th>
				<th>State</th>
				<th>Population(2016)</th>	
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>1</th>
				<th>Kano State</th>
				<th>15,076,892</th>	
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>2</th>
				<th>Lagos State</th>
				<th>12,000,598</th>	
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>3</th>
				<th>Kaduna State</th>
				<th>8,252,366</th>	
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>4</th>
				<th>Katsina State</th>
				<th>7,831,319</th>	
			</tr>
		</table>

</div>

<p><strong>Notice:</strong> This table shows clearly that any population trouble we have as a country willl definitely<br>  come from the north, hence my call for the division of the country.</p>
